            Welcome to Wander Notes, a personal travel blog where stories, memories,
            and discoveries come together. This space is dedicated to exploring cities,
            cultures, and hidden corners of the world through thoughtful reflection.

            Traveling is more than just sightseeing, it’s about understanding the people,
            history, and the little moments that stay with you long after the trip ends.
            Each destination leaves a mark, and my blogs help capture you in those experiences.
